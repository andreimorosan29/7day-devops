## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge we are going to dive deep into building a CI/CD Pipeline in AWS. By the end of the 7 days, we will have:
- A Web App set up in the Cloud
- A GitHub Repo connected with AWS
- Secure packages implementation with CodeArtifact
- Continuous Integration with CodeBuild
- A deployed Web App with CodeDeploy
- IaC (Infrastructure as Code) created with CloudFormation
- A fully built CI/CD Pipeline with the use of AWS Services

## Hold me accountable!

I am looking forward to set aside at least 3 hours per day for the next week to work on this challenge. I am keeping myself accountable with the help of the platform and one of my friends. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be a nice cheesecake.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps (Development Operations) is a set of practices that combines development of products (code writing) and operations (Deploying and Maintaining said code) to facilitate development cycles and deliver reliable software in a swift and responsible manner. 

DevOps Engineers are the wizards that implement those practices within an organization through:

+ Building Automated Pipelines (e.g. AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, Github Actions) that test, package and deploy software so releases become faster and reliable.

+ They Containerize applications with tools like Kubernetes or Docker which help applications at scale.

+ They turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can manage and configure resources within an organization on the go without always manually configuring them.


### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Development. The end goal of CI/CD is to facilitate the flow from code changes to a live application. This process helps teams to build products in a fast and reliable manner.
